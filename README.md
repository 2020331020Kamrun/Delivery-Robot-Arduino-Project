## DELIVERY ROBOT

---

## Abstract
With artificial intelligence taking over the present world, the necessity and use of automated products in our day-to-day life have increased significantly. This project aims to explore the development and implementation of a restaurant delivery robot to increase the efficiency of the restaurant delivery system.

The delivery robot that we are aiming to make will be a line-following robot. It will be programmed to avoid any kind of obstacles on its way and will be designed to follow a predefined path for completing its task. This robot will use several sensors to track its path. Our goal is to bring such a robot to life which will be able to carry a small amount of load and deliver it to its programmed destination efficiently. We will be using the microcontroller Arduino Uno for the project and DC motors for the robot's mobility.

## Introduction
The idea for autonomous systems has evolved to make our life easier and more efficient, essentially saving both time and cost of our day-to-day activities. An autonomous robot is a robot that performs particular tasks in accordance with its design, without the need for human assistance. Our project aims to build such a system, keeping these goals in mind.

At present, the restaurant delivery system is completely based on human labor. As a result, the challenges that restaurants have to face are many, including delayed delivery systems and cost inefficiencies. During the COVID-19 pandemic, challenges regarding social distancing came to light, especially in businesses and public places like restaurants. The options that could operate in a fully contactless environment were limited. In such cases, the idea of autonomous food delivery systems gained prominence.

## Related Work
The development of automated food delivery robots was still in its early stages of commercialization 2-3 years back. However, after the COVID-19 pandemic, its popularity and importance have significantly increased. In 2021, the market size of intelligent food delivery systems in China reached $600 million. By 2026, it is expected to reach $3.2 billion. Even though the market for this system is increasing for large-scale businesses, the use of such automated systems is not very common in root-level businesses, especially in a country like Bangladesh. Existing systems have undergone several stages of development and testing but still lack the feasibility required to incorporate them into medium to high-budget businesses in our country. Our project aims to eliminate the existing gap in the use of such technology and make it available to the masses by providing a cost-effective solution within our available limited resources.

## Proposed Solution
In light of the existing challenges mentioned above, we aim to build a delivery robot using the Arduino Uno microcontroller that will be cost-effective, avoid obstacles, and maintain a reliable delivery system according to its programmed structure. It will be a line-following robot programmed to collect and deliver food items to specific points. The robot will have the ability to avoid obstacles, ensuring pedestrian safety. For implementing the delivery robot, we will use DC motors, sensors, lithium-ion batteries, and range-adjustable IR sensors. This robot will increase efficiency by reducing delivery time and minimizing delivery mistakes. It will reduce costs as the monthly salary expense will decrease significantly; the only regular expense remaining will be the negligible maintenance charge compared to the monthly expense for human workforce.

## Aim and Objectives for the Proposed Solution
The proposed solution has the following objectives:
- **Design and Development:** Design a feasible path for the robot to follow and develop the necessary software components for autonomous navigation.
- **Navigation and Control:** Use appropriate mapping algorithms for precise positioning and identifying delivery routes. Develop a control system to pass instructions for the robot to follow.
- **Obstacle Responses:** Develop a system to respond to obstacles that come in the robot's path.
- **Cost Effectiveness:** Conduct a cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the economic feasibility of deploying delivery robots instead of human-driven delivery systems.
- **General Use Cases:** Applicable in restaurants, hospitals with flat surfaces, warehouses, and supershops. Since it is a line-following delivery robot, its application is not limited to any particular service; it can be used for delivery purposes in any environment for carrying small to medium amounts of objects.

## Hardware Requirements
1. **Arduino UNO:** A microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P with 14 digital input/output pins, 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button.
2. **IR Sensor:** Detects and responds to infrared radiation in the environment. We will use range-adjustable IR sensors.
3. **Motor Driver:** DC motor drivers for the robot's mobility.
4. **BO Motor:** A geared DC motor with a 3-12V operating voltage, suitable for the project.
5. **Wheels:** For the robot's mobility as it will be a line-following robot.
6. **Lithium-ion Battery:** Rechargeable batteries ensuring long-lasting service.
7. **Jumper Cables:** For necessary connections in the robot.
8. **Sonar Sensor:** Uses acoustic pulses and their echoes to measure the range to an object.

## Conclusion
In summary, the development of a line-following restaurant delivery robot using Arduino Uno, IR sensors, and other essential components presents a compelling solution to modernize and streamline the food delivery process. By introducing this cost-effective and efficient robotic system, we address existing challenges in the industry, such as delays and cost inefficiencies. Through careful planning, hardware integration, and software development, our proposed solution aims to provide a reliable and adaptable alternative. This project not only caters to the current demands of the restaurant industry but also has the potential to bring about a significant shift in the adoption of autonomous delivery systems, offering a versatile and accessible solution for various sectors beyond dining establishments.
